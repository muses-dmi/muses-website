# Numerical Methods for Physical Modelling and GPUs

Direct numerical methods which have long been studied and applied in physics and mathematics are powerful schemes used to simulate physical phenomena. By simulating the physics of sound wave propagation through instruments and environments, new synthesizers and effects can be accuratly modelled. Physical modelling was for a long time impracticle to compute for most applications. With the level of computational power available today, they are becoming more viable. This project has explored the acceleration of numerical methods for physical modelling by processing on Graphics Processing Units(GPUs).
