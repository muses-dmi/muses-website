# Overview

Pat is a miniature domain specific programming language (DSL) which is heavily influenced by [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org). This language was implemented as a means to explore an abstract representation of sequences of musical events for digital musical instruments.

With this representation,  we can then provide a number of applications for music in various digital systems.

Currently we provide an example that integrates with the Muses Audio Platform, a playground app that will be available for download and exploration soon!
