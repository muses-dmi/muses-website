# Overview

Pat is a miniature domain specific programming language (DSL) which is heavily influenced by [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org). This language was implemented as a means to explore an abstract representation of sequences of musical events for digital musical instruments.

We have used Pat to illustrate a number of perspectives on this and will continue to use it in future work.


## Applications

### - [Audio Examples]({{< ref examples >}})

We can listen to an example of _Pat_ directly converted to audio in here and get an idea of how _Pat_ is used.

### - Muses Audio Platform

Currently we provide an example that integrates with the Muses Audio Platform, a playground app that will be available for download and exploration soon!

We can listen to an example of _Pat_ directly converted to audio in this example:

### - Muses Audio Platform
We also demonstrate use of _Pat_ when building the 'Circle Sequencer', stay tuned for the project page that has all the details on that project.
